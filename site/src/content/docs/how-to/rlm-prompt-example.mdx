description: "Real-world RLM prompt for analyzing a Jira CSV export."
---

Analyze the CSI (Customer Technical Support) Jira export at `Jira-2.csv.gz` (~709K rows, gzipped CSV) to identify recurring error patterns, top root causes, and systemic issues.

  Use the RLM pattern: partition the data across analyst agents, analyze in parallel, synthesize.

  &gt; **Note:** The RLM pattern now auto-detects content types. For this CSV file, it will detect `structured_data` and route to `swarm:rlm-data-analyzer` agents with header-preserving chunks. See [swarm:rlm-pattern](/skills/rlm-pattern/) for content-type detection and routing details.

  1. Team Lead: Decompress and assess the dataset. Determine column structure and row count. Partition into 8-10 roughly equal CSV chunks (preserving the header row in each). Use Grep to scout for high-density error regions
   — prioritize partitions with the most incident volume.

  2. Each of 8-10 Analyst agents: Read your assigned partition. For each chunk, report:
     - Top issue types and categories ranked by frequency
     - Recurring error patterns in summary/description fields (common phrases, failure signatures, repeated symptoms)
     - Component and product area breakdown
     - Priority and severity distributions
     - Resolution time statistics (min, median, p90, max) if resolution dates are available
     - Escalation and reassignment rates
     - Any outliers or anomalies worth highlighting

  3. Team Lead: Collect all analyst reports and synthesize into a consolidated analysis:
     - **Executive summary** — total volume, date range, overall health assessment
     - **Top 10 root causes** ranked by frequency and impact, with representative ticket examples
     - **Systemic issues** — recurring patterns that indicate process, tooling, or architectural problems
     - **Temporal trends** — month-over-month or quarter-over-quarter changes in volume, categories, or severity
     - **Component hotspots** — which products, services, or modules generate the most support load
     - **Recommendations** — prioritized action items to reduce ticket volume, grouped by effort level (quick wins vs. structural fixes)
