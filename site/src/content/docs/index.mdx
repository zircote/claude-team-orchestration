# Use orchestration in Claude Code
/swarm:orchestrating

## What is swarm?

**swarm** is a Claude Code plugin that enables multi-agent orchestration. It provides primitives for creating teams of agents that work together on complex tasks through shared task lists, inter-agent messaging, and proven coordination patterns.

Key capabilities:

- **Team lifecycle** — Create, spawn, delegate, and shut down agent teams
- **Shared tasks** — Task lists with dependencies, ownership, and progress tracking
- **Messaging** — Direct messages, broadcasts, and structured protocol messages
- **7 patterns** — Battle-tested orchestration patterns for common workflows
- **RLM** — Recursive Language Model pattern for analyzing files that exceed context limits
- **Multiple backends** — In-process, tmux, and iTerm2 spawn modes
